# Adaptive Local Embedding Learning for Semi-supervised Dimensionality Reduction, TKDE 2021, to appear.

A semi-supervised locality-preserved dimensionality reduction method for dealing with non-Gaussian distribution data. 

ALLDA_semi.m is the main function, and others are sub-function. Please remove the null space of data via PCA before you run this code, otherwise the algorithm maybe not convergent.
